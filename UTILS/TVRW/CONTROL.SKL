! Lines that begin with '!' are comments. All other lines are copied to the
! generated output.
!
! Lines that begin with ` are quoted lines. Quoted lines are directly copied
! to output WITHOUT macro expansion. Use this if you need something in a line
! beginning with $(
!
! The following macros are defined in this file:
!
!  $(FULLNAME)   = fully expanded filename
!  $(FILENAME)   = 8+3 filename
!  $(FNAME)      = 8 char file name
!  $(FEXT)       = 3 char extension
!  $(RESNAME)    = the Resource ID of the generated dialog.
!  $(CLASSNAME)  = the name of the derived class, without the preceding T or P
!  $(MAKEFUNCTION)= expands to the Make function of the generated object.
!  $(DESCRIPTION)= The description of this item
!  $(AUTHOR)     = the author of the project
!  $(VERSION)    = the version of this project
!
!  You can also use a conditional "macro". It is called $(IFDEF xxxx), where
!  xxxx is one of the below listed strings. TVRW will ignore the lines
!  between $(IFDEF) and $(ENDIF) if the symbol xxxx is not defined.
!  NOTE: DO NOT write anything else in lines which contain $(IFDEF) and
!  $(ENDIF)
!
!   xxxx can be one of the following:
!     DERIVED         true if a new object type should be created
!     CPP
!     PASCAL
!
!     Anything else:  true if you gave them in the Sourcer Options dialog
!                     Defines inputline.
!
! These macros are case insensitive.
