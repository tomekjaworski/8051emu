Description of Example files
----------------------------

 .\BASEAPP :  A basic resourced application.  The baseapp.pas file
              was generated by Turbo Vision Resource Workshop's
              built-in sourcer, using TVRW's application skeleton
              file.  The baseapp.res file was generated from TVRW
              using the objects in the baseapp.rwp project file.

 .\HINTAPP :  A modification of the above, with a descendant
              TStatusLine object to display help hints.  The
              status.pas file was generated by TVRW, while the
              hintstat.pas file contains the declaration of the
              descendant status line.

 .\SOURCE  :  A basic application that does not use resources,
              except for the string list resource (used to store
              the help hints).  All files except for the
              hintstat.pas file were generated by TVRW.
