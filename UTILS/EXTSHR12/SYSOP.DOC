                         Short Description:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This Turbo Pascal unit (6.0 / 7.0 / 7.0 protected mode) allows you to
easily write Turbo Vision (R) programs with support for all enhanced
text modes of graphic cards.
The programmer will never have to worry about strange graphic cards
or about new programming tecniques, the end user will not have to
worry about his strange graphics card not being supported by
his favourite application.
Programs written in Turbo Pascal (R) with this unit will support
virtually any graphic card.
The programmer just includes one menu option, and his application
magically supports every graphic card ever built on this planet (!).
The end user uses a provided tool to create a configuration file
for his specific graphic card.
Fool-proof!

                         Long Description:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wouldn't it be nice to have more than just a standard 80x25 or
80x43 resolution in every application?
Nowadays every cheap-o graphic card does support special text modes,
say it 132x43, 100x60 or anything else. They really do look neat with
the sample programs that come with your graphic card, but they do
not usually work with third-party-programs.
That's because you can bet that the programmer that wrote the
application you would like to use did include drivers for lots of
graphic cards, but she/he sure did not include one that would work with
your vga card.
Our package provides both PROGRAMMERS and END USERS support for
applications which virtually support every graphic card ever
built on this planet.
The concept was really simple: the programmer writing the application
shouldn't have to worry about different graphic cards, neither should
she/he have to learn new programming technics, nor should she/he have
to change a lot just to have the video support included in already
finished programs.

That's the idea behind our EXTRASCR.TPx Turbo Pascal (R) Unit.
Whenever you write a Turbo Vision program, you just include our
unit and derive your application from TSCRAPPLICATION instead of
TAPPLICATION. That's it. You don't have to worry about anything else.
From now on your application will support every graphic card the
end user possesses.
On the other side, if you are an end user, you will just need a quick
glance at the manual that came with your graphic card to tell the
application how to support YOUR favourite text mode.
Your xyz card supports a strange thing like 97x41 text mode?
No problem! The application you just got will easily support it, too!
You don't have the original user's manual of your graphic card?
No problem! You start another little tool of our package and you
will easily find out what text modes your card (and your monitor)
support.
