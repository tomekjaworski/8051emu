    EXTRASCR.TPx version 1.20, release as of May, 1993
    --------------------------------------------------
                                                      

    Major changes since revision 1.00 are:
    --------------------------------------
    
    (1)  Full protected mode support with 386(sx)-class-machines and above.
         Compatible protected mode support for 286-class-machines, problems
         with 'forgotten' mouse cursors might occur.
         We recommend using protected mode WITH enhanced video modes only
         on 386(sx)-class-machines.
         Protected mode works fine in both Borland's and MS-WINDOWS'
         Dos Protected Mode.
    (2)  EGA/VGA 80x43/50 video mode included in mode selection box.
         Version 1.00 just didn't show up the mode selection box if no
         driver file was found.
         We recommend having an empty driver file (BUILTIN.DRV is provided)
         in order to still be able to select EGA/VGA modes.
    (3)  Solved mutually-exclusive problems.
         Version 1.00 sometimes kind of 'forgot' the mouse cursor on the
         screen while in enhanced screen modes.
         We fully solved this problem with 386(sx)-class-machines and
         above, and we diminished the occurence of those conflicts on
         286 and lower.
    (4)  Got rid of GPF's (general protection faults) in protected mode
         version caused by some interrupt services not provided by
         Borland's or Microsoft's Dos Protected Mode Interface's.
         The way the mouse cursor is drawn in real mode is completely
         different from the one in protected mode.
         The different mouse-status-buffer scanning tecniques used in
         version 1.00 are no longer necessary.
    (5)  Got rid of some minor bugs.
