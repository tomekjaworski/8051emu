===== Information for Users ("READ-ME") ================

This package contains Turbo Vision Resource Workshop(TM) v3.60 by BitSoft
Development, L.L.C.  This document contains only a very brief description
of the package and its features, along with instructions for its
installation.  Quite detailed documentation is included in the package,
but it is in archived form, and is more easily read after installation.

Turbo Vision Resource Workshop is a shareware program.  This evaluation
version includes all features of the program, and is not crippled in any
way.  You may use it for up to 30 days, without charge.  If you would
like to continue to use Turbo Vision Resource Workshop after this
evaluation period, you are required to purchase the licensed version of
the software (see "Purchasing the Licensed Version" in the README.EXE
file).  Any fee you may have paid to others (disk vendors, dealers, etc.)
to obtain this evaluation version was a fee for their copying and
distribution services, rather than a payment for continued use of the
program.

===== Installation =====================================

The installation procedure for Turbo Vision Resource Workshop is quite
simple. The package includes a program, "INSTALL.EXE", which automates
the entire process.  You will need about 1250k of available disk space on
the hard drive on which you plan to install TVRW, for a complete
installation.

The exact steps you need to take will depend on how you received
Turbo Vision Resource Workshop.


INSTALLING FROM DISKETTES

To install from diskette(s), you need to perform the following steps.

   o  Place the Turbo Vision Resource Workshop distribution diskette
      in the appropriate diskette drive.

   o  Execute the "INSTALL.EXE" program on the distribution diskette.
      For example, if the distribution diskette is on drive A:, type
      the MS-DOS command, "a:install".

   o  Follow the instructions presented by the installation program.
      You will have a chance to approve installation before any changes
      are actually made to the contents of your hard drive.  The
      program will ask you for a destination directory, and will copy
      the Turbo Vision Resource Workshop files to that directory.  It
      will make no other changes; specifically, it will not modify
      your autoexec.bat or config.sys files.


INSTALLING FROM A HARD DRIVE

If you downloaded Turbo Vision Resource Workshop from a BBS or an
Internet FTP site (or received it in the form of archive files from some
other source) you will need to perform the following steps.

   o  Extract the contents of the archive file(s) in a temporary
      directory on your hard drive.  The procedure for doing this
      varies, depending on the form in which you received the package.
      In all likelihood, the fact that you are reading this text means
      that you already have the necessary tools and knowledge to
      perform this step.  If not, you should be able to obtain
      directions for this from the same source from which you received
      the package.

   o  Execute the "INSTALL.EXE" program which you have extracted.  For
      example, if the temporary directory into which you have extracted
      the Turbo Vision Resource Workshop package is C:\TEMPDIR, you
      would execute the MS-DOS command, "c:\tempdir\install".

   o  Follow the instructions presented by the installation program.
      You will have a chance to approve installation before any changes
      are actually made to the contents of your hard drive.  The
      program will ask you for a destination directory, and will copy
      the Turbo Vision Resource Workshop files to that directory.  It
      will make no other changes; specifically, it will not modify
      your autoexec.bat or config.sys files.

When you're satisfied that the installation was successful, you should
delete the temporary directory FROM which you installed Turbo Vision
Resource Workshop (C:\TEMPDIR, in the above example), including all
its contents.


READY TO GO

Once you've complete the installation, you should consult the README.EXE
file.  In particular, you should read at least the "About Turbo Vision
Resource Workshop" and "Using TVRW the first time" sections of the
README.EXE file.  That document will tell you what you need to do to
start using the program and provides other information that you need to
properly evaluate Turbo Vision Resource Workshop.  We hope you enjoy the
software!


UNINSTALLING TVRW

To uninstall the shareware version of Turbo Vision Resource Workshop,
simply remove the directory where you installed it, along with all the
files and subdirectories contained in that directory.  By default, the
directory where Turbo Vision Resource Workshop is installed is
C:\BitSoft\TVRW.
